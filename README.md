# Flight Delay Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting flight delays. By analyzing historical flight data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors, this project aims to provide accurate predictions of flight delays, helping airlines and passengers better manage their schedules.

## Features
- Data Collection:
  - Gather historical flight data including flight times, airline information, origin and destination airports, and weather conditions.
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Perform EDA to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and visualize correlations between features and flight delays.
- Model Training:
  - Train multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- Model Evaluation:
  - Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Model Deployment:
  - Deploy the best performing model using Flask to create a web application for predicting flight delays.

## Insights
1. Data Analysis:
   - Identify key factors influencing flight delays, such as weather conditions, time of day, and specific airlines.
2. Model Performance:
   - Compare the performance of different models and select the best one for deployment.
3. Feature Importance:
   - Analyze the importance of different features in predicting flight delays.
